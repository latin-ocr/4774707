The copyriqnt iaw of the United States (Titie 17, United
States Code) governs the making of the photocopies or
other reproductions of copyriqhted materiai including
foreign works under certain conditions. in addition, the
united States extends protection to foreign works by
means of various internetionai conventionS, bilaterai
agreements, and proclamationS.

Under certain conditions specified in the law, iibraries
and archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy or
other reproduction. One of these specified conditions is
that the photocopy or reproduction is not to be “used
for any purpose other than private study, schoiarship, or
research.” if a user makes a request for purposes in
excess of “fair use,” that use may be iiabie for copyriqht
infrinqement.

The institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a
copy order if, in its judgment, fuifiiiment of the order
would involve violation of the copyriqht iaw.
